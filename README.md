“SmartPark” is a car parking finder and booking application which helps the driver to find suitable car parking location for them. Parking problem has become one of the key causes behind traffic congestion in big cities. In Dhaka city the number of cars has increased but drivers cannot find car parking nearby or in suitable place considering price and traffic congestion. Since usage of Android based phone has increased in Bangladesh, a car parking application would make thing easier. SmartPark is an android based application which can search for car parking slot considering nearest or low-priced parking space. The user logs into the account and want to select a parking location for a good amount of time. The application takes the user’s location and makes a search for nearby parking locations with the least distance. The distances are sorted using binary search tree in the background. User can also consider the nearby low priced parking location. After selecting the parking spot, the user can book the parking spot and timer count begins. When the user’s vehicle gets out of the parking spot, the timer is stopped and the amount to be paid manually is shown. A user can be one parking sport at a time.
The final version is the smartpark. Other folders are experimental modules. Most works are done in DistanceComparison branch.
